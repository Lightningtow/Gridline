# Gridline
This is an app that uses [Spotify-Web-Api-Kotlin](https://github.com/adamint/spotify-web-api-kotlin) and Jetpack Compose (https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose) to provide utils for shuffling and quickly editing Spotify playlists. This will eventually provide all of the functionality provided by [my Python, terminal-based Spotify shuffler](https://github.com/Lightningtow/Spotify_Shuffler), with a clean, easily-usable interface. 

It is still in alpha, under heavy development. Many functionalities have not been implemented yet, but the shuffling works as intended, and the other utils are coming along quickly.
